# The Shields Experiment

One day, i learned how quickly you can set up a visitor counter using `visitor-badge.glitch.me`.

That Day, I realized how beautifully powerful the badge pattern can be: try implement a visitor counter yourself, from scratch, that can count visits with a different counter for every page...

All in all, this work is about designing an architecture for a static website :
* the static website is managed with one of the following CMS :
  * `hugo`
  * `Gatsby`
  * `Directus`

## About Secrets Management and CORS


It is possible to provide a token or credentials for a number of external services:
*  Like a private `Drone CI`, or a private `Gitea`
*  These may be used to lift a rate limit or provide access to private resources from a self-hosted instance.
