## The Shields Experiment

One day, i learned how quickly you can set up a visitor counter using `visitor-badge.glitch.me`.

That Day, I realized how beautifully powerful the badge pattern can be: try and implement from scratch a visitor counter, that can count visits with a different counter for every page...

All in all, this work is about designing an architecture for a static website :
* the static website is managed with one of the following CMS : `hugo`, `Gatsby`, `Directus`, etc...
* the static website has many features thanks to badges :
  * visitor counter
  * [soon more..]
